<p>These are only some of the more general efforts, within specific domains there
are even more. The point is so many efforts exist because there is a need
to address deep-seated problems with how scientific software has historically
been developed. So let’s look at the typical scientific software package circa
2000.</p>
<section id="scientific-software-circa-2000">
<h2>Scientific Software Circa 2000<a class="headerlink" href="#scientific-software-circa-2000" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Many legacy scientific software packages grew organically with little to no
design. In many cases new packages sprung up because existing packages did
not fill a need, or because the existing packages had differing philosophies,
<em>e.g.</em>, open vs. closed source, functional vs. object-oriented. While legacy
packages may have had different origin stories, the lack of design,
particularly with respect to interoperability, means that when a feature of
another package was needed it was often easier to re-implement the feature
than to interface to the other package. Hence over the years, each package’s
feature set tended to converge to a set of standard algorithms. Each of these
algorithms has now been implemented a number of times, resulting in a
substantial amount of duplicated work. At the same time few, if any, of
these redundant implementations have been developed in a modular fashion, in
turn perpetuating the cycle <span id="id13"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#id31" title="A. Krylov, T. L. Windus, T. Barnes, E. Marin-Rimoldi, J. A. Nash, B. Pritchard, D. G. A. Smith, D. Altarawy, P. Saxe, C. Clementi, T. D. Crawford, R. J. Harrison, S. Jha, V. S. Pande, and T. Head-Gordon. Perspective: computational chemistry software and its advancement as illustrated through three grand challenge cases for molecular science. The Journal of Chemical Physics, 149(18):180901, 2018. doi:10.1063/1.5052551.">22</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>After years (decades in many cases) of the above cycle, the average legacy
package contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Millions of lines of code</strong>. Often this code base is poorly
documented, lacks consistent formatting, has widely varying quality, has poor test
coverage, and involves multiple coding languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hundreds of features</strong>. Many of these features are loosely integrated silos,
meaning there are only a handful of developers who know how a feature works and
these features are only integrated with some of the package’s other features,
<em>e.g.</em>, a new optimization routine may only be accessible from the algorithm
it was written to support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monolithic code base</strong>. Somewhat ironically, even though features are
loosely integrated with one another, each feature tends to be tightly coupled
to the code base, <em>e.g.</em>, works by assuming existing quirks of other code,
relies on a particular global state existing. In turn, even if the code base
is comprised  of libraries and/or components, these components rarely
function without the rest of the code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insurmountable technical debt</strong>. A “just get something working” mentality
has been used for much of the software’s lifetime. Each invocation of this
mentality has added more tech debt. Unfortunately, tech debt tends to
compound exponentially.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While modularity is not a silver bullet, many developers acknowledge that if
legacy software had been designed and written in a more modular manner current
development efforts would be easier. At this point adopting a more modular
design requires repaying too much technical debt for it to be practical and
many legacy packages are left with two choices: start from scratch, or continue
to push the current development model to its breaking point.</p>
<p>To be fair there are a lot of other factors which shaped how legacy software
came to be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Poor attribution</strong>. Historically publications are the currency of academia
and publishing software developments has been difficult. When software does
get published it’s often for a release and the resulting paper has hundreds
of authors. This provides little incentive for a developer to do more than
the bare minimum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funding agency expectations</strong>. Decades of delivering software in a “just
get something working” state (and often overselling how primetime ready it
really is) has resulted in funding agencies expecting software on unrealistic
timelines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of formal training</strong>. Most scientific software is written by scientific
domain experts who have little to no formal computer engineering skills.
Historically this means that there has been a large amount of ignorance
regarding best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not invented here syndrome</strong>. It’s embarrassing to admit, but in scientific
software development there tends to be a heavy bias against using software
developed externally to the team. Part of this is because such software is
often used in a “black-box” manner, which can be off putting to scientists
who want to understand how everything work. Another part of this is a
belief that other developers produce inferior products.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research is not industry</strong>. There is a prevalent belief throughout academia
that developing research software needs to play by different rules than
industrial software development. In many cases this belief stems from the
fact that academics often occupy many roles other than software engineer,
notably they are also often users of the software. By contrast, most software
engineers in industry spend the majority of their time writing software.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, while legacy software represents a substantial investment in
terms of time and money, in many cases existing legacy packages are
unsustainable. The number of organizations dedicated to developing better
research software is a direct result of not wanting to repeat the same
mistakes moving forward.</p>

<section id="what-sets-scientific-software-apart">
<span id="id14"></span><h2>What Sets Scientific Software Apart?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-sets-scientific-software-apart" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As suggested by the intro to to this page, there is an increasing interest in
developing better more sustainable scientific software. If we are to capitalize
on these efforts we need to understand what makes developing scientific
software challenging, and how to avoid repeating the problems of legacy
software. With regards to why scientific software is unique:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Performance</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Scientific software is among the most computationally expensive software
in the world. The high computational complexity of many algorithms means
that even a small degradation in performance can result in a simulation
becoming intractable.</p></li>
<li><p>Often requires high-performance computing</p></li>
<li><p>Performance is heavily tied to hardware; as hardware evolves so will the
scientific software.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Scientific motivation</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Software is typically seen as a means to an end and is usually developed by
the scientists themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Benefit to cost ratio of dependencies must be large, i.e., dependencies are
usually only considered if they save a lot of time, or are very performant.
In addition, the scientists need to have some level of assurance that the
dependency will continue to be supported in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Most scientists prefer to do as little software development as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dynamic nature of scientific research</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Scientific research is by its nature highly uncertain. Promising
avenues may not pan out. Funding sources dry up. New hot topics emerge.</p></li>
<li><p>Workflows vary widely among researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Users may come up with use cases beyond the scope of the original software.</p></li>
<li><p>Research leads to new quantities of interest, and software needs to be
extensible to support these new properties.</p></li>
<li><p>New algorithms for computing a property emerge. The software architecture
needs to be able to use these algorithms throughout the code.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Complex nature of scientific research</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Scientific simulations of real world phenomenon have many pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Science domains are often hard to grasp for non-experts.</p></li>
<li><p>Current scientific research projects are often multi-disciplinary.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Need for rapid prototyping</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Design space for most scientific algorithms is huge. Need to be able to
quickly scan this space.</p></li>
<li><p>Python is at present the <em>de facto</em> language of choice for rapid
prototyping.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Decentralized scientific software development</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Developers are typically spread out across the world, making synchronization
difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>The scientific software community encapsulates an entire range of software
engineering capabilities. Therefore, the quality of contributions and
software products can vary widely.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a need to protect unpublished research to ensure publication
rights. Decentralized development allows you to keep your unpublished
research separate.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the above considerations can be handled by ensuring a modular code
base. When done well, modularity leads to encapsulation and a separation of
concerns. This in turn makes it easier to refactor code for performance, add
support for new theories, work on a feature without affecting other researchers,
and reuse contributions from other groups.</p>
