<span id="design-checkpoint-restart"></span><h1>Checkpoint/Restart<a class="headerlink" href="#checkpoint-restart" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>The need for checkpoint/restart (C/R) was briefly touched upon in
<a class="reference internal" href="memoization.html#memoization-design"><span class="std std-ref">Memoization Design</span></a> with a full discussion deferred to this section. From
the PluginPlay perspective C/R is a subset of the memoization needs, more
specifically C/R amounts to avoiding recomputation by using a previously created
checkpoint. In PluginPlay C/R is unified with memoization by using the
checkpoint to create a Cache instance.</p>
<section id="what-is-c-r">
<h2>What is C/R?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-c-r" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>C/R is the high-performance computing equivalent of saving/loading. In
conventional usage C/R primarily targets fault resilience (being able to resume
a program when something goes wrong) and is typically done in the background of
the program’s execution. Typical C/R usage usually has a short turn around time
from the checkpoint action to restarting. On the contrary, saving/loading is
typically a manual process (the chooses to save; although the program may also
maintain an autosave back-up as a convenience) and usually strives to store the
data in a manner ammenable to resuming work after a prolonged period of time. In
modern practice the exact distinction between save/load and C/R is fuzzy at
best and for our purposes we consider them together under the unified concept of
C/R.</p>
<p>C/R is typically handled in one of two ways: by the operating system (OS) or by
the application. While OS-based C/R is automatic (from the application
developer’s perspective) it’s of limited utility in that it’s extremely
expensive (the OS more or less snapshots the state of all running programs and
all memory). The main application of OS-based C/R is suspending/hibernating the
current user’s session. OS-based C/R is typically not designed for transferring
the checkpoint state to other devices and the next user action after a
checkpoint is expected to be resuming the session (albeit with possibly a
significant amount of time between the actions). On the contrary,
application-based C/R is not automatic (although tools help to facilitate it),
can be expensive or cheap (depends on what is being checkpointed and how the
developer does the checkpointing), and allows other actions to occur between the
checkpoint and the restart.</p>

<section id="why-do-we-need-c-r">
<h2>Why Do We Need C/R?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-need-c-r" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Historically many electronic structure packages have had limited or no C/R
capabilities. However, fault rates are expected to increase substantially with
exascale computing making it prudent for us to consider C/R if for no other
reason than resliancy. Arguably the more important reason to have C/R is for
scientific integrity. It should be possible to reload previous results and
verify/build upon them in some manner. Another reason is user friendliness.
Users have come to expect their state to be saved in most serious programs.
Having C/R means a user doesn’t need to rerun the entire program just because
an error occurred.</p>

<h2>C/R Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#c-r-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are a number of C/R considerations which we have grouped based on whether
they pertain to the objects being C/R, the hardware being used to C/R, or the
design of PluginPlay.</p>
<section id="object-considerations">

<h2>C/R Implementations<a class="headerlink" href="#c-r-implementations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Saving/loading is an ubiquitous aspect of the modern user experience. For this
reason we expected to find a number of existing C/R candidates; however, we
were only able to locate a few existing libraries. It is possible that we are
not using the correct terminology (we tried both the C/R and save/load
terminology), or that C/R is just so intimately tied to a program’s design that
no good general solution exists.</p>

<section id="c-r-strategy">
<h2>C/R Strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#c-r-strategy" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The existing C/R libraries do not seem to be widely used. Perhaps the larger
problem with the existing C/R libraries is that it is not clear what they have
to offer (unless our program is so simple we can just tell it what memory
addresses to monitor). For this reason, we have opted to implement our own C/R
solution.</p>
<p>C/R is a form of memoization and we intend for it to occur in PluginPlay via the
cache concept. Thus we punt almost all of the C/R considerations to the cache
discussion in <a class="reference internal" href="cache.html#cache-design"><span class="std std-ref">Cache Design</span></a>. The exceptions are the following
considerations which we address here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The amount of data to checkpoint can be formidable</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the current strategy turning on/off memoization also turns off C/R.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Generally speaking, in PluginPlay most data that needs checkpointed will live
in the cache.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the primary motivation behind unify the two.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reloading a cache will allow PluginPlay to quickly regain parity with the
previous calculation by relying on memoization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current C/R strategy relies heavily on this consideration</p></li>
</ul>
